<br><b>How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?</b>
<br>I can interpret user needs and implement them into a program by taking detailed notes about their requests. I can also ask questions that encourage users to other features and options to reduce the possibility of unforeseen changes in the future. Creating user stories helps with this by not only providing an organized worksheet to collect notes on the user's requests, but also breaking each request down by its importance so developers know what should be focused on first.

<br><b>How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?</b>
I approach developing programs by writing down everything that needs to be coded and then arranging them list or chart that connects each piece of code when required. The agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work is taking time daily to examine what I accomplished and what I still need to work on, and working on each task in increments rather than scrambling to accomplish as many things as possible.

<br><b>What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?</b>
Being a good team member in software development means thinking about the success of your team first, and asking yourself how your actions could positively or negatively impact your team members. It is also important to keep one's word since the other team members are relying on you to get certain tasks done. In the event that something comes in the way, a good team member communicates before waiting for problems to be handled by someone else.
